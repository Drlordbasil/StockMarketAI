# Real-Time Stock Market Analysis

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the stock market using Python. By utilizing web scraping techniques, it fetches real-time stock market data, performs data analysis, and offers valuable insights to users for informed investment decisions.

## Features

- Data Retrieval: The program uses web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup to extract real-time stock market data from financial websites or APIs. It collects information such as stock prices, trading volumes, company news, and historical data.

- Analysis and Visualization: The program incorporates various data analysis techniques to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in the stock market data. It utilizes libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to create visualizations such as line charts, candlestick charts, and histograms, providing users with clear insights into market trends.

- Portfolio Management: Users can create and manage their investment portfolios within the program. It tracks the performance of individual stocks, calculates portfolio metrics like total value, returns, and volatility, and provides an overview of the portfolio's overall performance.

- Alerts and Notifications: The program includes a feature that enables users to set price thresholds for specific stocks. It sends real-time alerts and notifications to users when the price of a stock reaches the target level, helping them stay updated with market movements.

- News Aggregation: The program scrapes financial news websites to gather the latest news and updates related to specific stocks or industries. It summarizes the news articles using natural language processing techniques and presents them to users for quick analysis and decision-making.

- Machine Learning Integration: By employing machine learning algorithms, the program can either predict stock prices or analyze sentiment from news articles. This integration allows users to gain additional insights, which they can consider while making investment decisions. Libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow can be utilized for this purpose.
